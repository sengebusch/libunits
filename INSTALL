On most systems it should be save to do:

  ./configure
  make


The installation has to be done as root:
(the standard paths are /usr/local/lib for the shared library,
/usr/local/bin for the utility programs and /usr/local/share/libunits
for the database files. Use ./configure to change this, if needed)

  make install


The compilation has beed testet on SuSE-9.3 up to Open SuSE-13.2.

To compile the system specific untis database image file use as root:

  make images


The library might also be used without compiling the database, but
then the databased is parsed every time it is initialized.
As this can take a long time, the use of the compiled image file
is recommended.


For some easy examples take a look into the examples folder:

  cd examples
  less units-api-demo.c
  ./units-api-demo


HINT:
